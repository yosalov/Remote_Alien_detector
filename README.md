# Remote_Alien_detector
Remote Alien Detector seeks to incorporate the latest software and hardware technologies for the purposes of developing a reliable accurate remote non-human detection system to be used with smartphones. 
Guidance: TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 
a) asses available hardware and software technologies related to human biometrics including thermal imaging and microwave cameras, parabolic microphones and other possible remote biometric readers. 
b) Use and calibrate all of the above technology preferably creating redundant systems for 100% accurate human biological entity verification.
c) Use and calibrate all of above technology to detect known terrestrial animals, preferably with accurate life form identification.
d) Use and calibrate all of the above technology to detect known robotics and non biological systems.
By process of elimination of the above entity detection what is left is EBE detection.
Base system should be developed and newer versions refined with added features and detection capabilities.
